# A3-chatbot
GenAI
To create a chatbot in Python that can answer questions about Ollama, you can use the discord.py library for creating a Discord bot. Here are the steps to set it up:

Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install discord.py.

sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install discord.py
Step 2: Create the Bot
Create a file named bot.py and add the following code:

Python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# Create a bot instance with a command prefix
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

# Knowledge base for Ollama
ollama_knowledge_base = {
    "what is ollama": "Ollama is a platform for ...",
    "how to use ollama": "To use Ollama, you need to ...",
    "features of ollama": "Ollama offers features such as ...",
    # Add more Q&A pairs here
}

# Event listener for when the bot is ready
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Bot {bot.user} is online!')

# Command to handle user queries
@bot.command(name='ask')
async def ask(ctx, *, query: str):
    query = query.lower()
    if query in ollama_knowledge_base:
        await ctx.send(ollama_knowledge_base[query])
    else:
        await ctx.send("I'm sorry, I don't have an answer for that question about Ollama.")

# Run the bot using your token
bot.run('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN')
Step 3: Run the Bot
Replace 'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual Discord bot token. Then, run the bot:

sh
python bot.py
Adding More Q&A Pairs
You can extend the ollama_knowledge_base dictionary with more questions and answers about Ollama.

This bot listens for the !ask command followed by a question. For example, a user can type !ask what is ollama and the bot will respond with the corresponding answer from the knowledge base.
